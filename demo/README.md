# Netis SMLR Tech Preview — live demo app

Point SMLR at **this machine's real telemetry** and watch it monitor in real time: live
CPU / memory / load, and the system's real-time logs. Two tabs — **Metric Monitoring** and
**Log Monitoring** — each streams frames to the **SMLR SGLang inference server on the GPU
host** and shows the model's per-frame cognition: the policy action (`WAIT → WARN → ALERT`),
its observation, its reasoning, and how escalation builds as an anomaly sustains.

Inference runs on the GPU host (SGLang, continuous batching). The demo app itself is a **thin
client** — no model, no torch, no GPU on the client side.

## 1. Start an inference server (GPU host)

Two server flavors — pick the one for the interface you want:

**Token-stream server** (for the HTML dashboard, option A) — streams each frame token-by-token
(the policy DECISION the instant prefill finishes, then `reasoning` token-by-token). Uses the
published model via transformers:
```bash
# on the GPU host — model dir has modeling_smlr.py + config auto_map (or point at netis-ai/smlr-metrics-1b)
MODEL_DIR=$HOME/models/smlr-metrics-1b GPU=<idle> PORT=8140 python stream_server.py
curl -s http://localhost:8140/health           # {"ok": true, "mode": "token-stream", ...}
```

**SGLang frame server** (for the Gradio app, option B) — returns a whole frame at once; see
[`../inference/REPRODUCE.md`](../inference/REPRODUCE.md) to set up the SGLang port:
```bash
PORT=8100 SGL_GPU=<idle> CKPT=$HOME/models/smlr-1b-ml6 ./start_sgl_server.sh
```

## 2. Reach the server from where the demo runs

If the demo runs on another machine (e.g. your laptop), tunnel the port over SSH:

```bash
ssh -N -L 8140:localhost:8140 <gpu-host>       # token-stream server (option A)
ssh -N -L 8100:localhost:8100 <gpu-host>       # SGLang frame server (option B)
```

## 3. Run the demo (client)

**A. Custom HTML dashboard** (left = live metrics + charts, right = model output) — a real
**token stream over Server-Sent Events**: a background loop continuously samples telemetry and,
per frame, opens a token stream to the GPU host — the decision badge appears immediately, then
`reasoning` types out token-by-token in the browser, then the final status lands. No client
polling; inference only runs while a browser is connected.
```bash
cd demo
pip install -r requirements.txt                # httpx + psutil (+ gradio for option B)
SMLR_STREAM_URL=http://localhost:8140 python web.py     # open http://localhost:8130
```

> **What "stream" means here (honest).** The *transport* is a real push stream, and *output* is
> token-level (ASR-style partial→final). But SMLR is a **frame-level** event reasoner — it consumes
> discrete frames (a metrics snapshot / a batch of log lines) one at a time, ~1/s, not a continuous
> signal. True input-incremental streaming (persistent KV + delta feed + a StreamingLLM sliding
> window) needs a streaming-format retrain and is out of scope for this preview.

**B. Gradio app** (tabbed: Metric + Log monitoring):
```bash
SMLR_SERVER_URL=http://localhost:8100 python app.py
```

- Click **▶ Start** on a tab to begin streaming; **⏸ Stop** to pause. One frame every ~3 s.
- **To see it escalate:** create real, sustained load — e.g. `yes > /dev/null` (CPU), a
  compile, or a memory hog — and watch the Metric tab move `WAIT → WARN → ALERT`. On a
  healthy machine it correctly stays `WAIT` (not crying wolf is the point).

## How it works

- **`collectors.py`** (runs on the client) — real host data. `HostMetrics` samples
  CPU/mem/load/disk/net via `psutil`; `HostLogs` tails the system's real-time logs
  (`journalctl -f` on Linux, `log stream` on macOS, or a file via `SMLR_LOG_FILE=/path`).
- **`smlr_client.py`** (runs on the client) — the closed loop, no model: render frame →
  `POST /v1/frame` to the SGLang server → **carry `state_patch` forward** into the next frame,
  and synthesize a `tool_result` when the model queries a tool so the query→confirm→alert
  loop completes.
- **`app.py`** — the Gradio UI (two tabs, "Netis SMLR Tech Preview" throughout).

## Honest note on domain

The served metrics tier was trained on a specific synthetic domain — **network-link**
telemetry (`latency_ms / loss_pct / jitter_ms / throughput_mbps`) and specific host-log
incident types. Real host CPU/memory and general syslog are **out-of-distribution**. The demo
*projects* host utilization into the trained schema (high utilization reads as "degradation"),
which lets the discriminate-then-alert machinery engage on genuine load — but detections here
are a **preview**, not calibrated production monitoring. Full methodology, results, and
limitations: [`../TECHNICAL_REPORT.md`](../TECHNICAL_REPORT.md).

## Config

| Env | Default | Meaning |
|---|---|---|
| `SMLR_SERVER_URL` | `http://localhost:8100` | SMLR SGLang server (tunnel to the GPU host) |
| `SMLR_LOG_FILE` | *(auto)* | tail this file instead of journalctl/`log stream` |

Cadence is a constant at the top of `app.py`.
